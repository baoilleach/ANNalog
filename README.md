# ANNalog

ANNalog is a **SMILES-to-SMILES** generative model for medicinal chemistry analogue design.

- **Paper (ChemRxiv):** https://chemrxiv.org/doi/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9c1v6

ANNalog is a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model designed to generate medicinal-chemistry-relevant analogues of an input molecule. It supports:
- **local chemical-space exploration** (small, SAR-like modifications), and
- **scaffold hopping** (changing the core scaffold while remaining chemically relevant).

---

## Dependencies / environment (recommended)

A tested dependency set is provided in **`seq2seq_environment.yml`** in this repo (recommended for reproducibility).

Notes:
- The PyPI package **does not pin or install PyTorch** for you. Please install a PyTorch build that matches your system (CPU/CUDA).
- If you use the provided conda YAML, you’ll get a known-good environment for generation.

## Installation

### Option A — Install from PyPI (recommended for “just use it”)

```bash
pip install annalog
```

After installation, you can use the installed CLI:

```bash
annalog-generate -h
```

### Option B — Install from GitHub (recommended for development / editing code)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DVNecromancer/ANNalog.git
cd ANNalog
```

**Conda (recommended):**
```bash
conda env create -f seq2seq_environment.yml
conda activate <env_name_from_yml>
pip install -e .
```

## Generating molecules

You have **two ways** to generate:

1) **Installed CLI** (works after `pip install annalog`): `annalog-generate ...`  
2) **Repo script** `generation.py` (works from a cloned repo; easy to modify)

Both share the same core options:
- decoding methods: `beam`, `BF-beam`, `sampling`
- exploration modes: `normal`, `variants`, `recursive`
- TSV/CSV output

---

### Exploration methods (what they mean)

#### `-e normal` (default)
Generate directly from the input SMILES.

#### `-e variants`
1) Create `--variant-number` *SMILES variants of the same molecule* by **randomizing atom order** and writing **non-canonical SMILES** (i.e., different syntactic representations of the same structure).
2) Run generation from **each** variant and pool all results.

#### `-e recursive`
Run generation in multiple rounds. In round 1 you generate from the input SMILES.  
In round 2, you generate again using **the round-1 outputs as new inputs**, and so on for `--loops` rounds.

## A) Using the installed CLI (PyPI / installed package)

Help:
```bash
annalog-generate -h
```

**Quick start (single SMILES, beam, 50 outputs):**
```bash
annalog-generate -i "CCO" -n 50 -m beam -o gen.tsv
```

**Sampling (10 outputs):**
```bash
annalog-generate -i "CC(Cl)Br" -n 10 -m sampling --temperature 1.2 --seed 42 -o gen.tsv
```

**Variants exploration:**
```bash
annalog-generate -i "CCO" -n 20 -e variants --variant-number 10 -o gen_variants.tsv
```

**Recursive exploration (2 loops):**
```bash
annalog-generate -i "CCO" -n 10 -e recursive --loops 2 -o gen_recursive.tsv
```

You can also invoke the same CLI via Python module form:
```bash
python -m annalog.cli -i "CCO" -n 50 -o gen.tsv
```

**Resources (ckpt + vocab):**
- For the installed CLI, the checkpoint + vocab are shipped **inside the package** and used by default.
- You can still override them if needed using `--resources-dir` or `--checkpoint/--vocab`.

---

## B) Using the repo script (generation.py)

From the repo root (after `pip install -e .`), you can run:

```bash
python generation.py -h
```

**Note about resources in the repo:**  
In this repository the checkpoint/vocab live under:

`annalog/ckpt_and_vocab/`

So when running `generation.py`, point it explicitly:

```bash
python generation.py \
  -i "CCO" \
  -n 50 \
  -m beam \
  --resources-dir annalog/ckpt_and_vocab \
  -o gen.tsv
```

## Output format

The output file includes a header row with columns:

- `input_smiles`
- `rank` (1-based)
- `generated_smiles`
- `score`
